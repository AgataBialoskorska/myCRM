___Maybe can I connect everything what I've been learning?___

__YES__

This project combines my skills in Python, API, SQL, and JavaScript/Vue.js.

This small CRM will use MySQL to fetch data from various databases/tables, convert it into a JSON file, and create an endpoint. Then, Vue.js will fetch the generated JSON file and display the data in the app.

Work in progress.
